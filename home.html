          always the best conversation. U coming up to me and getting on ur knees proposing me front of the entire school and giving me a rose ahhhh what a nice day
          anyways jokes apart, ik how it all happened. You came asking me to wait for u after school ends before my cs class 2nd last period on thursday 18th april 2024, and then us meeting in the hallway when u were going to pick osman
          and what an amazing start to a love story. Nothing can beat this eva. If I was a romance movie director i would 100% make a movie about us and it would be the best romance movie ever 
          The way u came to ask me LITERALLY WHEN I ALREADY HAD CRUSH ON U AND I ALREADY MADE ALL MY DUAS AND LAYLATUL QADR AND ALL THATT WOWWWWW, ah man now i regret not praying properly anymore. 
          You were the sign for me that miracles from Allah do happen if u pray for it. I will start praying more now cuz we both going through a lot and I just hope nothing stops us from meeting on december.</em></strong>

        <p style="scale: 1.2; margin-left: 150px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); max-width: 1100px;"><strong><em>Some of the best days of our lifes, goscore + neeraja ma'am tuition days, the amount of fun we would have walking together and the way time used to go by so quick was 
          so amazing, we would talk non-stop even from the first day itself like wow. and the way u started holding my bag then my arm then finally my hands slowly slowly cuz ur scared to cross road WOWWWWW
          and i remember the first time u held my actual hands through my fingers, when we were crossing the road at the signal and i remember how slowly the time was going for me that day
          i remember highlighting this in my notes app, hahahahha speaking of which i remember saving it under * basketball * and one day in insects car u asked for my phone and i was like i anyways dont have anything 
          to hide so hahah i gave and when u gave back i saw notes app is open and i cant recall what u wrote but smtg u wrote and i was like omg did u read or not , then i checked how i locked my that * basketball * note so 
          ik u couldnt see but still, i remember i used to document what u like and what u dont, and under what u like i wrote, * she also doesnt know what she likes * and u were laughing at it when u read that hahahahha
          and ik its sad how i used to do effort before and now im like barely anything, my love im sorry for that but its just idw to do the same thing over n over for u 
          and it doesnt mean i dont love u, it just means ik ur already mine now i just have to make u happy, and with the gap between our physical body and the gap in the time makes it annoying and hard
          like i want to talk to u and spend time with u but now see from 12pm after u slept 6 hours im doing nothing like ok i cooked n all but keeping the works aside, I would have atleast 
          2-3 hours of free time to talk to u and if u were online i would even finish other things quicker just so we can talk more. ok ok anyways now about our tuition days 
          i remember this tuition day in goscore where U DUMBASS U MSGED ME SAYING U WONT COME TUITION TODAY, and i was half way to tuition and i lost all mood to go tuition and iw as like 
          what do i do now damn, and i started walking so slowly cuz i didnt want to go only, but then slowly slowly i walked and when i reached i see u in there 
          AND OK OK I SAID I HATE U BLABLA BUT THIS IS THE CONTEXT, I HATED THE PRANK THAT U PULLED ON ME THAT MADE ME THINK I WONT GET TOO SEE U. and thats not a bad thing 
          that shows how i got so sad and upset ha. Anyways U DIDNT EVEN HAVE NET BTW, U COULDNT EVEN SAY ME IF U WERE JOKING, WHAT IF I WENT BACK HA.
          anyways i aint even finna talk ab the day we did stuffs in the builing hehehe. and omg it was kinda scary after we started hearing sounds and sometimes seeing the haris 
          but wtvr it was still so fun hahhaa i cant believe we did all that omg wow. and then when we started neeraja maam tuition WHICH I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE HELL DID OUR PARENTS NOT FIND OUT 
          HAHAHAHAH I WAS SO SCARED CUZ I FR THOUGHT NO WAY THEY WONT FIND OUT. BUT U SAID WE CAN HIDE IT AND FYI WE DID HIDE IT CUZ I FAKED MY TUITION ADDRESSEE HHAHAHAH. 
          omg i remember whenever we used to go tuition and some days u didnt eat properly then we would order so many tasty foods and drinks and wven sweets sometimes and dont even talk about the 
          papaya and pineapple wtvr rubbish drinks u had to drink ONLY FOR U TO OVERTHINK hahahahaahaha that was so scary for us but overall the tuition days were the best, we could bunk tuition, we would go outside someday
          after our tuition and wowww it was so damn fun i miss it soo much.</em></strong></p>

        <li style="margin-left: 300px; scale: 1.5;">Our dates</li>

        <p style="scale: 1.2; margin-left: 150px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); max-width: 1100px;"> <strong><em> man how nicely we went on so many dates and never got caught, even the day before i came aus we went out and it went smoothly and 
          it was one of the best dates, it was also the last time i got to see my adorable smollie, touch my adorable baby, feel my adorable baby, kiss my adorably baby and hug my adorable baby, in general all 
          our physicality that was the last day for it until december again where i can do it all over again. The first date in avenues and the last date before coming aus also was avenues 
          its like where we started we finished hahaha thats a cute touch MANNN I WISH I COULD MAKE A MOVIE ouf. On our first date i still re OOOOO even on our first avenues we went disney store cuz i wanted to get u 
          some plushies and we didnt get and then last time we went that day also we went disney store and we ended up not buying anything again hahaahha. 
          ah man the first day was so nice, we walked so much then had raising canes and there started our first burger days, from that day onwards i made u eat burgers fries pizza and godknows what rubbish
          but thats how a husband/bf should be and when i can live with u ill daily make sure to make u eat tasty tasty things and healthy oso. and then we had icecream also in avenues baskin robin and we walked so much 
          and it was so fun in general, and then 360 malls, assima mall omg assima mall day was so nice i loved roaming with u there we had subway and u loved it so much wow
          then 360 mall dont even talk ab osmanli and how much u loved that kabab on our first day and said how u wanted it so badly hahahah it was so cute and then we went again on the day we bunked tuition
          and then again after school farewell, i think we went 360 the most. and ofc sometimes dajeej and the pani puri challenge which will recreate december for sure.
          then mujamma also here and there but mostly i would just drop u there and lev cuz it was risky, then burger king also i think the last tiem we went there was chem exam day we ate pizza discussed then went neeraja maams house 
          ah man how many mini dates we went too, i labed em ollllllllllllllllllllll i cannot wait to go out again on december.</em></strong>

      i stare at it a lot more than u think i am. i see it day and night, i want to put this as my wallpaper but idw to risk anyone seeing u but its truly a master piece of a picture that u sent
      the dress looks so cute on u, the big eyes, the smooth hairs, the tongue is what might be making me stare more and maybe the specs too, but in general idk something about this pic is just too good and perfect, 
      its just like absolute cinema, uk the meme yea like htat. i dont really know what to say but i just love the pic so much i jus stare at it and time goes by, the past few days whenever ur ont online and i miss u badly i jus go to this picutre and stare at its perfection.
      not even Ai can generate a picture prettier than this. Maybe the hand placement has something to do with the pic too cuz i mean look at that, oh and maybe cuz its like a portrait pic cuz ur not staring at the camera, idk waht it is 
      im no photographer but all ik is that thats one hella amazing picture. I just love this picture so much and it wont get out of my head only i can just imagine it.
